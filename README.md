# IOT-BASED-SOLAR-PANEL-CLEANING-SYSTEM

## Description
  This project is used for automatic/manual cleaning of solar panel whenever it is required. First of all it will measure the level of dust by using LDR sensors. LDR sensor will measure the intensity of sun, as intensity decreases dust will be detected if not there is no dust. When the level of dust is increases up to specific value at that time intensity will be reduced, so user get an alert msg on telegram bot for clean the solar panel. Also with the help of ESP32-cam module user will get photo panel on same telegram bot so that user can know false triggering is done or not. False triggering is due to cloudy weather or monsoon season. Also for turning on motor we have used one manual switch.
